# My Progress
[x] Lesson 1
  #### What I learned
    - Need to include vue.js file to work: <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
    - Use this syntax to introduce variable message - {{message}}
    - Craeate a new instance of Vue, and pass options el: which is an element selected, and data: which contains the variables
    
````JS
    	var app = new Vue({
		el: '#app',
		data:{
			message: 'Do not go gently into that good night'	
		}
	});
  
````
